      <p class="para">In Ecuador, It is illegal to have, sell or buy wild animals. The ministry of environment confiscate them, punish the people and bring the animals to wildlife rescue centers to help the conservation of the species and the forests. In 1993, Angelika Raimann and Remigio Canelos, a Swiss-Quichua couple, with their friend Christine von Steiger, wanted to protect the fauna of the Amazon, so they created an NGO called amaZOOnico, a center that would receive, rehabilitate, and reintroduce wild animals that had been confiscated from illegal trade. In order to fulfill the plans for reintroduction it was important to create another project that would be exclusively dedicated to the protection of the rainforest itself, working with the community towards a common goal of sustainable and practical resource use. Such was the birth of Selva Viva: a large umbrella project which would come to include 1750 hectares of protected forest, a trilingual school for the neighbouring community and two Eco-lodges (Liana Lodge and Runa Huasi) which promote ecotourism. </p>
