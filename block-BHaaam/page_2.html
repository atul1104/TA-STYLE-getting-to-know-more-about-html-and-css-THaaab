    <p>Annually millions of animals are taken from their natural habitat. Some of them live in terrible conditions for their entire lives; many others die of malnutrition, illnesses or abuse. Only a few of them are fortunate enough to get a second chance. Help us to care for them. With your donations you will help feed them, buy their medicine, give them specialized medical treatments, provide them with a home, and develop projects that encourage the protection of the rainforest and its inhabitants. </p>
